/**
 * Carve language definition for highlight.js
 *
 * Carve is a Djot-derived markup language with distinct inline delimiters:
 * emphasis is /text/ (not _text_), underline is _text_, strikethrough is
 * ~text~ (Djot uses ~ for subscript), subscript is ,text, and highlight is
 * =text= (Djot uses {=text=}). Strong (*text*), superscript (^text^),
 * insert ({+text+}) and delete ({-text-}) match Djot.
 *
 * This file is a UMD module so it works in every documented integration:
 *
 * - ESM: `import carve from '@markup-carve/carve-grammars/highlightjs/carve.js'` (resolved to
 *   the carve.mjs shim via the package `exports` map), then
 *   `hljs.registerLanguage('carve', carve)`.
 * - Classic `<script src=".../highlightjs/carve.js">` after highlight.js: it
 *   self-registers against the global `hljs` (and exposes `globalThis.carveHljs`).
 * - CommonJS contexts that load this file as CommonJS get the factory on
 *   `module.exports`.
 *
 * A top-level `export default` is intentionally NOT used: that would be a
 * syntax error when the file is loaded as a classic browser script.
 *
 * INDENTED BLOCK OPENERS, and why this file differs from the TextMate grammar
 * in the same package (carve-grammars#138, #89, #71):
 *
 * Carve opens a block at column 0, or at an enclosing container's content
 * column - nowhere in between. ` # H`, ` > q`, ` *[A]: x` and an indented fence
 * are all paragraphs at document level, while the same four openers at a list
 * item's content column are real blocks. Telling those apart needs block
 * context, and highlight.js modes here are line-based: this grammar has no
 * container model, so it cannot ask the question.
 *
 * So every block opener here stays anchored `^[ \t]*` and knowingly
 * over-colours the indented-at-document-level case. Anchoring at column 0
 * instead would not buy accuracy - it would stop highlighting EVERY
 * legitimately indented construct inside a list item or a block quote, which
 * is the common valid shape, in exchange for correcting a rare invalid one.
 *
 * The TextMate grammar tracks a list item's content column (carve-grammars#137)
 * and therefore CAN split the two: its `heading`, `fenced_code`, `blockquote`
 * and `abbreviation` rules are anchored at column 0, with `_in_container`
 * twins reachable only from inside a container. That divergence is deliberate
 * and is written up in the README ("Where the three grammars deliberately
 * differ"). Do not "fix" the anchors here to match it.
 *
 * A LEADING BYTE ORDER MARK (carve-grammars#154):
 *
 * A byte order mark at the START OF THE DOCUMENT is not content - the spec says
 * so ("Line endings and a byte order mark"), and carve-js, carve-rs and
 * carve-php all strip it before the block scanner runs. It is neither a space
 * nor a tab, so without an allowance it sat between the line start and the
 * marker and defeated every `begin` below that opens a block: a BOM-led heading
 * went unscoped, and a BOM-led fence was claimed by the inline code rule.
 *
 * The allowance is `(?:(?<![\s\S])\uFEFF)?`, and the assertion is the point.
 * highlight.js compiles these with the `m` flag, so a plain `^\uFEFF?` would admit
 * the mark at EVERY line start - and a mark that is not at offset 0 is an
 * ordinary zero-width character that opens nothing. Measured:
 * `# T\n\n\uFEFF- item\n` is a paragraph holding literal text in carve-rs and in
 * carve-php. Only carve-js reads it as a list, because JavaScript's own `\s`
 * class is Unicode White_Space plus U+FEFF (markup-carve/carve#806), and that is
 * the outlier. `(?<![\s\S])` is true only where nothing precedes.
 *
 * Only OPENERS carry it. A closer (the code, div and block-comment
 * `end`s) and a definition body line cannot be line 1, so they are untouched.
 * `LINE_COMMENT` needs nothing either, but for a reason worth naming: its
 * `(?<=\s)` already admits the mark, because JavaScript's `\s` holds U+FEFF.
 * That is the same quirk as above, working in this one rule's favour.
 *
 * The codepoint is always written as the escape `\uFEFF`. No file in this repo
 * holds a literal byte order mark: it is invisible, and an editor or a
 * normalizing filter can drop the one character a rule is about.

         * backslash in front of and mean it: `x =\= y` renders `x == y` with no
         * mark, and this mode opened a run the engine does not.
         *
         * THE RUN CONSUMES AN ESCAPE AS A PAIR and refuses a bare backslash,
         * rather than counting the backslash run in a lookbehind. Counting is
         * what #385 shipped and what carve-grammars#390 replaces: a lookbehind
         * that repeats a group has to be BOUNDED or it backtracks superlinearly
         * (carve-grammars#380), and every bound is reachable - at `{0,32}` the

         *
         * ONLY HALF THE FIX IS HERE. The guard proves a closer EXISTS; the span
         * comes from `end`, which highlight.js applies on its own and which
         * would still stop at an escaped `=`. What stops it is HIGHLIGHT listing
         * ESCAPE in `contains` - that submode begins at the backslash, one
         * column before the delimiter, so it wins by position and eats the pair.
         * Neither half works alone: without this one the mode never opens,
         * without the other it closes on the escaped delimiter.
         *
         * THE BOUND COUNTS ATOMS, and an escape pair is two characters, so the
         * worst case is 8192 rather than 4096. Still a constant per position,
         * which is all the bound is for; halving it would halve every ordinary
         * body too.

         * A lookbehind ANYWHERE in a mode's `end` stops highlight.js closing

         * flank, `[^\s\n]=(?!\w)`, closes correctly but starts one column

         * the tie and closes on the `\=` that carve-grammars#390 exists to
         * refuse. Both measured on a two-line grammar before this was written.
         *
         * SO THE FALSE CLOSER IS EATEN INSTEAD OF REFUSED, the same shape #390

         * column before `end` could fire, so it wins by position and takes the
         * delimiter as content; `end` then only ever sees a closer that stands
         * against a non-space. Nothing about `end` changes, so this composes
         * with the escape submode rather than fighting it.
         *
         * THE GUARD IS THE OTHER HALF, and it may consume, because it is inside
         * a lookahead where nothing is really taken. Without it a run with no
         * real closer would open, eat its false closers and colour to the end
         * of its parent - worse than the over-scope this fixes. `notCloser`
         * widens for the same reason: `a *b * c* d` is a bold run in the

     * `=` of `<=` and scoped the sentence (carve-grammars#325). The guard is
     * a LOOKAHEAD ONLY: not BEFORE `>`, which is `=>` and the tail of `==>`.
     *
     * NOTHING IS ADDED TO THE LOOKBEHIND, and that was measured rather than
     * assumed. `<`, `>` and `!` were each put there and reverted: highlight.js
     * resolves its compiled alternation by POSITION, and TYPOGRAPHY carries
     * `<=`, `>=` and `!=`, so on `a !=b c= d` the comparison starts one column

     * grammar changed its answer, in a container or out of one, so those three
     * characters would be guard nobody can see working. The Prism grammar does
     * need them: Prism applies TOKENS IN ORDER rather than by position, and
     * 'highlight' is declared before 'typography' there.
     *
     * `=` IS IN THE OPENER'S OWN LOOKAHEAD HERE and not in the other two
     * grammars, because those spell the body as `[^=\n]+?` and get the same
     * refusal from the content class. `paired` derives its guard from the
     * CLOSER, so nothing here requires the body to be non-empty: `x == y`
     * opened and closed on the two `=` of a doubled run and scoped an empty
     * highlight over a line the engine renders literally.
     *
     * THE CLOSER IS DELIBERATELY NOT GUARDED AGAINST SMART TYPOGRAPHY, and the
     * asymmetry is the engine's: once a highlight is open the closer wins over
     * the pattern, so `x =y z<= w` marks `y z<` and `x =y z=> w` marks `y z`.
     *
     * AN ESCAPE IS A DIFFERENT QUESTION (carve-grammars#385). An escaped `=` is
     * not a delimiter at all - `x =\= y` renders `x == y` with no mark - and
     * this mode closed on one. `paired`'s third argument is what says so; it is
     * the only mode here that asks for it, because it is the only closer a
     * document can put a backslash in front of and mean it.
     *
     * ONE SHAPE IT COSTS: `<https://e.example>=hi=`, where the `>` closes an
     * autolink rather than opening a comparison. A fixed-width lookbehind
     * cannot tell the two apart, and this takes the under-colouring side of
     * that trade - the ticket's own reasoning, since a false highlight claims
     * the document holds a construct it does not.

     * FENCED CODE AND RAW BLOCKS - ONE MODE PER BLOCK, NOT ONE PER DELIMITER.
     *
     * A code block's payload is NOT Carve (spec PART 9 §2, `code_content`:
     * "any text until matching fence, preserved literally"), and until
     * carve-grammars#309 this file said so about the delimiters only: the
     * opener and the closer were two independent single-line modes with
     * NOTHING between them, so the body was handed to the full top-level mode
     * list and
     *
     *     ```
     *     x *b* y
     *     ```
     *
     * coloured `*b*` `strong` inside code. That is the markup-carve/carve#1239
     * shape one construct over - a payload that is recognized and still live -
     * and it is worse than leaving the block unhighlighted, because the output
     * then claims the document says something it does not.
     *
     * A begin/end mode with an EMPTY `contains` is what makes a payload inert
     * in this engine: highlight.js offers a mode's `contains` and nothing else
     * inside it, so an empty list is the whole suppression. The two delimiter
     * lines keep the `keyword` scope they always had through `beginScope` /
     * `endScope`, and the body carries `code`.
     *
     * THE CLOSER IS REQUIRED UP FRONT, the same guard `BLOCK_COMMENT` carries
     * below and for the same engine reason: highlight.js has no begin->end
     * backreference, so a mode that opens on an unpartnered fence runs to END
     * OF FILE and greys out the rest of the document.
     *
     * THE FORWARD SCAN IS BOUNDED, because proving there is NO closer costs a
     * scan to end of input and a document can carry many openers that have
     * none. The bound is 32 KB rather than the 8 KB `BLOCK_COMMENT` uses, and
     * the difference is the point: a code block THAT BIG is an ordinary
     * document (32 KB is some 800 lines of source), and past the bound the
     * fence opens no mode and its payload goes back to being live prose - which
     * is this issue again, at a size. Measured on a hostile 200 KB document
     * carrying 100 openers with no closer ahead of any of them: 23 ms at 8 KB,
     * 57 ms at 32 KB, 114 ms at 64 KB, 284 ms at 256 KB, linear in the bound
     * and linear in the document at each of them. 32 KB buys the blocks people
     * write for a cost that stays in the tens of milliseconds on a document
     * built to be slow.
     *
     * A HOSTILE DOCUMENT IS ALSO HARDER TO BUILD HERE than for `%%%`, which is
     * why the bounds differ at all. A comment fence closes on an EXACT width,
     * so a file of runs of INCREASING width leaves every one of them unmatched
     * and pays the scan once each - linear input, quadratic work. A code fence
     * closes on any run at least as long, so that same file matches every
     * opener at the next line; leaving N openers unmatched needs strictly
     * DECREASING widths, which costs O(N^2) characters to write down.
     *
     * WHAT THAT TRADES AWAY, written down rather than left to be rediscovered:
     * an unterminated fence at DOCUMENT level really does open a block that
     * runs to the end (grammar.ebnf, A CLOSER IS REQUIRED: "``` alone ... still
     * opens a code block that runs to the end"), and here it does not - it
     * falls to `LONE_CODE_FENCE` below, which colours the delimiter
     * line and leaves the lines under it as prose. That is the reading this
     * file had for every fence before #309, kept for the one shape it is still
     * right about: inside a container an opener with no closer opens NOTHING,
     * and a mode that ran to end of file there would swallow the container's
     * own closer and every block after it.
     *
     * THE CLOSER MATCHES ITS OPENER, and the rule is not the colon fence's.
     * A code fence closes on the SAME fence character at a length >= the
     * opener's (PART 9 §2, `code_fence_close`), where a colon fence wants an
     * exact length (§12) - so `DIV_BLOCK`'s width check next door is `!==` and
     * this one is `<`. Measured against the engine: ``` closed by ```` is one
     * code block, ```` closed by ``` is not.

    // div" meant "anywhere after the first container in the document".
